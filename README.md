# Abstract
This report addresses two independent data analysis requests using Bayesian statistical methods. Part I evaluates whether a new marketing landing page improves conversion rates compared to the existing page, using binomial likelihood with Beta priors. Posterior simulations reveal minimal probability (≈9–12%) that the new page outperforms the old, with results converging regardless of prior assumptions. The analysis recommends retaining the old page, while suggesting further customer segmentation studies to explore potential subgroup effects.

Part II examines hospital length of stay (LOS) using patient admission data to inform insurance reimbursement strategies. Exploratory analysis identifies a log-normal likelihood as the best fit for LOS, with uninformed priors ensuring minimal bias. Bayesian regression shows that higher in-hospital activity does not necessarily extend LOS; in fact, severe cases (including in-hospital deaths) correlate with shorter stays. Probability modeling indicates most patients remain hospitalized for more than two days, reflecting structured care pathways rather than illness severity. Findings highlight the need for insurers to incorporate hospital workflow context into risk models, rather than relying solely on LOS or activity metrics.
